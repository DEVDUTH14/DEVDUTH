# DEVDUTH
I am a Business Analyst and Physicist transitioning rigorous academic research methods into actionable business strategies. By applying hypothesis testing and complex modeling to real-world challenges, I help organizations identify hidden inefficiencies and scale revenue. Currently, I am an Intern at NoBroker, using data to optimize sales funnels and streamline operations. My technical toolkit includes SQL, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning, allowing me to build robust ETL pipelines and predictive models that drive decision-making.


# Key Impact
**Revenue Growth & Strategy**: Identified bottlenecks causing 48% revenue loss and recommended solutions to recover ₹4 Cr in value; spearheaded benchmarking that revealed a ₹50-150 Cr market opportunity.

**Process Improvement & Automation**: Reduced data processing time by 99% at CSIR-National Physical Laboratory by automating preprocessing workflows with Python and SQL.

**Data-Driven Modeling**: Engineered a property valuation model increasing accuracy by 12%, directly yielding ₹50 Lakhs through improved negotiation power

# PROJECTS

1.**EV Market Expansion Analysis (Washington State)** | Python, K-Means Clustering, Tableau.

**Objective:** Validated business hypotheses regarding EV adoption drivers using state licensing and infrastructure data.

**Execution:** ngineered a "Twin Engines" framework using K-Means clustering to segment counties by economic potential and infrastructure readiness.

**Outcome:** Disproved affordability/range as primary barriers; identified that charging infrastructure deficits were throttling growth in 16 high-potential counties.
      
2.**Stock Price Prediction Engine (Banking Sector)** | Python, LSTM Neural Networks, Technical Analysis.

**Objective:** Determined the optimal feature set for predicting stock prices across Indian and US banking sectors (e.g., HDFC, JPMorgan).

**Execution:** Built and trained LSTM models to compare "Trend/Momentum" indicators against "Volatility/Volume" sets over a 4-year dataset.

**Outcome:** Proved "Trend" indicators delivered superior accuracy (lowest MSE) for 75% of banks; recommended specific signal strategies for trading platforms.

3**Optimization of Climate Prediction Models** | Deep Learning (GRU/ANN), NASA CERES Data.

**Objective**: Tested if predicting correlated climate variables (Liquid Water & Ice Water Paths) jointly improves accuracy vs. independent models.  

**Execution**: Developed Single-Task and Multi-Task learning architectures using GRU and ANN models on satellite data.
    
**Outcome**: The Multi-Task GRU model achieved the best performance (MAE 0.0272), significantly outperforming single-task baselines by leveraging variable correlation.
