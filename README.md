## 📂 Projects

### 1. EV Market Expansion Analysis (Washington State)  
**Stack:** `Python` · `Pandas` · `K-Means Clustering` · `PowerBi`

- **Objective:** Validate which factors truly drive **EV adoption** and prioritize levers that unlock the next wave of growth.  
- **Execution:** Engineered a **“Twin Engines”** framework (economic potential + charging density) and used **K-Means clustering** on licensing, infrastructure, and demographic data to segment Washington counties.  
- **Outcome:** Disproved affordability and range as primary barriers; identified **16 high-potential counties** where **charging infrastructure gaps** are the main bottleneck to EV growth.

### 2. Stock Price Prediction Engine (Banking Sector)  
**Stack:** `Python` · `LSTM` · `Technical Indicators` · `Time Series`

- **Objective:** Determine the **optimal technical indicator set** for forecasting stock prices in Indian and US banking stocks (HDFC, SBI, JPM, BAC).  
- **Execution:** Trained **LSTM models** on a 4-year OHLCV dataset to compare a **Trend/Momentum** bundle (RSI, SMA, MACD, Stochastic) vs a **Volatility/Volume** set (ADX, ATR, OBV, Bollinger Bands).  
- **Outcome:** Showed that **trend/momentum indicators** achieved **lower MSE/MAE** and better accuracy for ~75% of banks, guiding **feature selection and signal design** for trading strategies.

### 3. Optimization of Climate Prediction Models  
**Stack:** `GRU` · `ANN` · `Python` · `NASA CERES`

- **Objective:** Test whether **multi-task learning** (jointly predicting Liquid Water Path and Ice Water Path) outperforms single-task models for key climate variables.  
- **Execution:** Built **Single-Task vs Multi-Task** architectures using **GRU and ANN** on NASA CERES satellite data, with robust preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Outcome:** The **Multi-Task GRU** achieved the best performance (**MAE ≈ 0.0272**), significantly beating single-task baselines by exploiting the **strong correlation** between LWP and IWP.
